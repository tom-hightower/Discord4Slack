## Note: Due to Slack's official dark theme and a patch for the css injection in 4.0.1 that made this theme work, this repository is now deprecated
---
## Make your Slack workspace look more like Discord!

### v3.0.1 (for Slack 4.0.0 Production)

### Automatic Installation Instructions

##### Requires Slack 4.0.0 or later, Node.js, and npm

#### Step 1: Clone the repo and run the installer (works on OSX, Linux, and Windows (via WSL, cmd/powershell support coming soon))

- `./install.sh`
  - You may have to `chmod +x install.sh` first if it won't let you execute it (and run as root on some systems)
- Note: Most updates are pulled in automatically. On major version updates you may need to remove the old version before installing the new version (see [Removing](#Removing) below)

#### Step 2: Relaunch Slack

- Get confused by how much it looks like discord and how easy that was!

#### Step 3: ???

#### Step 4: Profit?

### Updating

Most updates are pulled in on Slack launch. On major version updates: If you installed via the automatic installer, just re-run the installer to update! If you installed manually, just remove the old code and add the up-to-date version.

### Removing

To remove Discord4Slack, run the command `./install.sh --uninstall`

### Manual Installation Instructions

Currently unavailable due to the Slack 4.0.0 update. Coming back soon!
