# Discord4Slack
## Make your Slack workspace look more like Discord!


### Automatic Installation Instructions
#### Step 1: Run the installer for your OS as root in the same folder as Discord4Slack.js 
- WINDOWS: run `win_install.bat`
- MAC: `sudo ./mac_install`
  - You may have to `chmod +x mac_install` first if it won't let you execute it
- Note: If you already have the theme manually installed, please remove it before running this installer. Once you have it installed with the installer, consecutive runs will automatically remove the old version before installing a new one

#### Step 2: Relaunch Slack
- Get confused by how much it looks like discord and how easy that was!

#### Step 3: ???

#### Step 4: Profit?

Note:  I'm not affiliated with Discord or Slack (Unless they're looking for a developer *hint hint*), I just really love both of these pieces of software :)
