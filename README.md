# Discord4Slack
## Make your Slack workspace look more like Discord!

#### Step 1: Open ssb-interrupt.js in your slack installation in your favorite text editor 
- Path for Mac: `/Applications/Slack.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar.unpacked/src/static/ssb-interop.js` (open as root)
- Path for Windows: `%AppData%\local\Slack\<your-version-here>\resources\app.asar.unpacked\src\static\ssb-interop.js`

#### Step 2: Add the code in `Discord4Slack.js` to the bottom of that file

#### Step 3: Relaunch Slack
- Get confused by how much it looks like discord

#### Step 4: ???

#### Step 5: Profit?

Note:  I'm not affiliated with Discord or Slack (Unless they're looking for a developer *hint hint*), I just really love both of these pieces of software :)
