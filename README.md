### v3.0.0 (for Slack 4.0.0 Production)

### Automatic Installation Instructions

#### Step 1: Clone the repo and run the installer as root (works on OSX, Linux, and Windows (via WSL, bash/powershell support coming soon))

- `sudo ./install.sh`
  - You may have to `chmod +x install.sh` first if it won't let you execute it
- Note: Most updates are pulled in automatically. On major version updates you may need to remove the old version before installing the new version (see [Removing](#Removing) below)

#### Step 4: Profit?

### Updating

Most updates are pulled in on Slack launch. On major version updates: If you installed via the automatic installer, just re-run the installer to update! If you installed manually, just remove the old code and add the up-to-date version.

### Removing

To remove Discord4Slack, edit line 8 of `install.sh` to be `REVERT=true` and then run the installer.
